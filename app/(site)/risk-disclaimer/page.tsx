                Trading in financial instruments involves substantial risk and is not
                appropriate for every investor. The high degree of leverage that is often
                obtainable in financial trading can work against you as well as for you.
                The use of leverage can lead to large losses as well as gains.

                Before deciding to trade any financial instrument, you should carefully
                consider your investment objectives, level of experience, and risk
                appetite. The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss of some or
                all of your initial investment. You should seek advice from an independent
                financial advisor if you have any doubts.

                Hypothetical or simulated performance results have inherent limitations.
                Unlike actual trading records, simulated results do not represent actual

                under- or over-compensated for the impact of certain market factors, such
                as lack of liquidity.

                Simulated trading programs are generally designed with the benefit of
                hindsight. No representation is being made that any account will or is

                Trading foreign exchange, contracts for difference (CFDs), futures,
                options, and other leveraged products carries a significant level of risk
                and may not be suitable for all investors. You should be aware of the
                following risks:
              </p>

                  You may lose all of your invested capital. You should not invest money

                <li>
                  Leveraged trading can amplify both gains and losses. A small market
                  movement can result in proportionally larger losses.

                  Market conditions, including volatility, liquidity, and geopolitical
                  events, can change rapidly and without warning.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Stop-loss orders may not always be executed at the specified price due to
                  market gaps or slippage.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Technology failures, system outages, and internet connectivity issues may

                  Copy trading carries additional risks, as past performance of copied

                CFDs are complex instruments and come with a high risk of losing money
                rapidly due to leverage. A significant percentage of retail investor

                understand how CFDs work and whether you can afford to take the high risk
                of losing your money.
